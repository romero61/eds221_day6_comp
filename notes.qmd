# TIDY DATA

**variable**: a characteristic that is being measured, counted or\
described with data. Like: car type, salinity, year, population, or\
whale mass.

\
**observation**: a single "data point" for which the measure, count or\
description of one or more variables is recorded. For example, if\
you are recording variables height, mass, and color of dragons, then\
each dragon is an observation.

**value**: the recorded measure, count or description of a variable.\

# Messy data

-   Columns are values - rows are variables

-   Variables in Columns and Rows

-   Multivariables in a single column

# Why tidy data

-   Efficiency

-   Collaboration

-   Reuse

-   Generalizability

# Meet tidyr::pivot\_\*

\
Use tidyr::pivot_longer() to gather\
columns (convert from wide to long format)\
Use tidyr::pivot_wider()to spread\
columns (convert from long to wide format)
